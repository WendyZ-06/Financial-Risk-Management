# Quantitative-Risk-Management


The project involves the creation of a system using R that not only simplifies the complex process of risk calculation but also brings reliability and precision to risk assessment. By leveraging advanced computational methods such as Monte Carlo simulations, historical data analysis, and parametric approaches, the system is equipped to compute critical risk measures including Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). Furthermore, the system's flexibility allows for the incorporation of various stocks and options, accommodating diverse investment strategies and market conditions.
